preliminary version of a tool that takes files generated by [GloVe](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe), and then some text once the program has started, and outputs the same text with similar words. 

TO-DO: 

- [ ] fix `closest10` function to simplify itâ€”current use case only requires it to use one word at a time 
- [ ] learn how to set up my own corpuses so that I can train my own GloVe models 
- [ ] accomodate punctuation
